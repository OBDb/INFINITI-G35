    description: "The original Infiniti G35 Coupe was a luxury sports coupe built on Nissan's FM (Front Midship) platform shared with the Nissan 350Z and G35 Sedan. Featuring sleek, flowing styling with a long hood and short deck proportions, it combined sports car performance with luxury appointments. Powered by a 3.5L VQ35DE V6 engine producing 280 HP (later increased to 298 HP), paired with either a five-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission, it delivered impressive performance for its time. The rear-wheel drive layout, near-perfect weight distribution, and sophisticated suspension provided excellent handling characteristics that competed directly with established European sports coupes. The interior featured a driver-focused cockpit with good materials and distinctive styling, though some hard plastics detracted from the luxury feel. Available in base, Sport, and premium trims, it offered various equipment levels and suspension tuning options. This generation established the G35 Coupe as a genuine alternative to the BMW 3 Series Coupe and similar European offerings, winning numerous awards including Motor Trend's Car of the Year when combined with its sedan counterpart. The G35 Coupe played a crucial role in transforming Infiniti's brand image from a maker of rebadged luxury Nissans to a genuine performance-luxury manufacturer."

  - name: "First Generation (V35) Sedan"

    description: "The Infiniti G35 Sedan shared its platform and mechanical components with the coupe but featured distinctive four-door styling with more conventional proportions. Like its two-door counterpart, it was built on Nissan's FM platform offering a front-midship engine placement for optimal weight distribution. Powered by the same 3.5L VQ35DE V6 engine, initially producing 260 HP (later increased to 280 HP), it delivered sports sedan performance comparable to the benchmark BMW 3 Series. Available with a five-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission, and in rear-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations, it offered options for different driving preferences and climates. The interior featured a driver-focused design with amenities expected in the luxury segment, though material quality was sometimes criticized compared to European competitors. The sedan version broadened the G35's appeal beyond sports car enthusiasts to include luxury buyers seeking driving enjoyment with practical four-door utility. This generation established the G sedan as a cornerstone of Infiniti's lineup, attracting buyers who previously might have defaulted to German luxury brands. The successful reception of the G35 Sedan played a crucial role in establishing Infiniti's performance-luxury identity in the early 2000s, setting the stage for the brand's subsequent growth and expanded model range."
